# ReinforcementLearningMazeAgent
This is a small module which defines a maze, policy and agent so that the agent tries to go through the maze. 
It's designed to be easily used from an interactive python session though it can also be used as a library in another project

Example usage : start a new interaction python3 session
from ReinforcementLearningMazeAgent import *
maze.visualizeReward()
agent.playGames(1000)
maze.visualizePath()
agent.playGames(1000)
maze.visualizePath()
etc
